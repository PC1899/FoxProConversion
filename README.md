# FoxProConversion
Project to convert foxpro serial data in and out to .net serial data in and out
I am looking for someone to convert an old foxpro program that takes data from a serial port converts it and passes it out another serial port.
This program is used to generate license plate numbers for automation.
The source code running in foxpro will be provided.
